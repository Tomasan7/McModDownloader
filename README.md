# McModDownloader
A simple program to easily and quickly download Minecraft mods from Modrinth server. This mod is made in hurry to satisfy my needs, so please do not judge the code quality.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Tomasan7/McModDownloader/releases).
2. Simply run the jar with `java -jar FILENAME.jar`.  (replace the _FILENAME_ with the actual filename)
3. A `config.yml` will be generated. Fill it in based on the comments.
4. Run `java -jar FILENAME.jar` again and the mod downloading begins.

## Note
Since this program is made in a hurry, there's no error or rate-limit handling. When it crashes because of rate-limit, just wait a while and try again.
